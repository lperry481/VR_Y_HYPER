				<h2>Web XR uses</h2>
				<p>The XR within Web XR stands for Extended Reality which simply means to include VR, AR and MR, and all other immersive technologies such as mobile devices with positional tracking or fixed display with head tracking abilities. Extended Reality refers to all real and virtual environments generated by via computer graphics and wearables. Anyone can use WEB XR on a phone but on the website, it won't work right as it must be used on mobile phone or a headset only.</p>
				&nbsp;
				<h2>Basics</h2>
				<p>Virtual & Augmented Reality is revolutionizing the world with WebXR and WebAR which make it possible to augment reality through web browsers. Be it virtual meetings or product launches, or even furniture galleries, it provides direct web-based solutions, without consumers being asked to download an app. Such WebVR, WebAR, and WebXR samples provide a deep introspection into the future of the industry. Be it any domain, from marketing to home appliances, AR, VR, and WebXR have got it all covered. The era of Web Augmented Reality is booming with the 5G networking and the game-changing AI. It has all become possible because of the extensive web AR Frameworks which makes the development and rendering of AR in Web browsers possible. The industrial requirement of WebXR Application development is skyrocketing, as the industries are shifting from on physical presence to a virtual location independent, work from anywhere paradigm. Even the marketers now understand the positive influence of Augmented Reality Demos.</p>
				&nbsp;
				<h2>The Generation of Web XR</h2>
				<p>What WebXR is beyond WebAR and WebVR. It is an extended reality beyond your standard apps, through the Web. These are the most primary hurdles that AR/VR tries to jump through. The dedicated hardware layer is being bypassed, and this being the primary reason for migration and widespread acceptance of the technology. The end consumers get a taste of what they will be experiencing through a progressively rich method. WebXR further moves a step further for people with VR Devices and helps to design an augmented and more realistic perspective of the product which is being covered, hence ensuring more customer conversions. This interesting project from Google is a prototype of how cross-platform and device-independent software are gaining traction in the present day. Further, much more advanced APIs like WebXR have been developed to incorporate the holistic experience the Web Augmented Reality has reserved for the future. It will not be wrong to say that WebXR is to VR what the web browsers were to the internet in the 20th Century: It is going to be open access to VR, bringing the technology to the masses.</p>
