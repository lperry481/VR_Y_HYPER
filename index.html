				<h2>How VR is being used today</h2>
				<p>VR can transport a trainee into several different situations, places and environments for a range of training purposes. The military uses it for flight simulations, battlefield simulations, medic training, vehicle simulation and virtual boot camp, among other things. Virtual Reality (VR) holds an enormous potential to transform how people and businesses interact with each other as well as the surroundings. Previously VR was associated only with the gaming industry. Now itâ€™s on fire with new opportunities for use throughout today's society.</p>
				&nbsp;
				<h2>What is VR & AR?</h2>
				<p>For a start, Virtual Reality is a computer-generated simulation which has three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted within a real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors. Then there is also such reality called Augmented Reality which is technology that superimposes a computer generated image on a user's view of the real world that provides a composite view, for an example would be a pair of sunglasses which then brings up automatically a list of data/information within the glasses to the user to read or see but also let them go about their business unlike VR which can cover the persons view of the real world, AR is more open for users to play with. Also, these hardware's are not just based on their own platform but many others Pc but also for Xbox and PlayStation. There is also a reality called mixed reality which simply is a step beyond augmented reality that additional information is added to that what a user perceives, and the physical and virtual worlds interact, and users can interact with them as well. Lastly Web XR which will be explained within its own web page as it is all in one reality.</p>
